# STUCCO \[10-15\]
orthogonal **TKL** that comes in either **5** or **4** row design. 


## current status:
An internal GB was started and fulfilled by **Technofrikus**. 
They also designed a case for this pcb which they offer to print. 

**Besides there are some issues:**

- stabilizier orientation wrong for bottom row ( row5 )
- breaking of the lower row disables the two middle switches in row4 ( because I made a mistake for connecting the diodes accordingly)
- **this should be fixed afaik**


## Features: 

- built upon **rp2040**
- VIAL and QMK support ( technically ZMK possible too, yet not planned)
- GPIO-pinouts for additional features 

## Layout:

Possible layouts available for this pcb are pictured below. 

>**Beware** one can only reduce the amount of rows once ( as you permantly break off the lower row!).
